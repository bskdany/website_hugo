I hope this thing is working, I have never done anything like this before but hey, what better way of showing the stuff you're doing than a blog on the internet that no one will probably find or read.

Maybe it's going to be a sort of therapeutical writing about what is happening in my projects so that I can organize my mind better, rubber ducky sort of thing.

I have no expectations on this so at this point why not?
This is hosted on github pages because I 100% know that if I put this in a Docker Container one one of my servers it will get lost forever in a couple years, doing it this way I may have a nice time capsule too look at in 5/10 years ... hopefully.
